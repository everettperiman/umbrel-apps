  qBittorrent is an open-source software alternative to µTorrent. It's designed to meet the needs of most users while using as little CPU and memory as possible.

  
  This app comes bundled with VueTorrent, a sleek user interface that provides an alternative to qBittorrent's default interface.
  To enable VueTorrent, simply navigate to tools --> options --> Web UI and select "Use alternative Web UI".
  

  ⚠️ qBittorrent downloads torrents over the Clearnet, not Tor.
